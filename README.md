## Reflection
Creating this Etch-A-Sketch project challenged me in many ways but also taught me many new skills. I gained a better understanding of DOM manipulation and events. Due to the many amount of options available - different sizes and styles - I was able to explore new ways of approaching and solving problems I came across.
